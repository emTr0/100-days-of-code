### Day 1: June 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I completed 8 challenges in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** This will be considered the first day of my 100 days challenge. I completed many other challenges before this day but none that were long enough days/streaks to be considered part of this challenge. I recently decided to switch from learning Python to learning JavaScript, with the goal of becoming a full-stack JS developer. I'm very excited to participate in the 100 days challenge and look forward to everything I will experience, people I'll meet and things I'll learn.

### Day 2: June  6, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I completed 10 challenges in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today was difficult because I moved and was super tired. Once I was settled enough at my new place I sat down and worked through some of the challenges on freeCodeCamp. I kept dozing off. I'm glad I did it though! I really want to stick to this. I completed a few challenges yesterday but they didn't add up to an hour so I'm not counting them.

### Day 3: June 7, Friday 

**Today's Progress:** I completed 22 challenges in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was more rested today so I was able to work through more challenges more quickly than the last few days. I'm still enjoying myself! I got a few courses on Udemy to eventually work through. I'm looking forward to that as well. Definitely see this going somewhere.
