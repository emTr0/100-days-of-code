# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed 8 challenges in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** This will be considered the first day of my 100 days challenge. I completed many other challenges before this day but none that were long enough days/streaks to be considered part of this challenge. I recently decided to switch from learning Python to learning JavaScript, with the goal of becoming a full-stack JS developer. I'm very excited to participate in the 100 days challenge and look forward to everything I will experience, people I'll meet and things I'll learn.
