### Day 0: June 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I completed 8 challenges in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** This will be considered the first day of my 100 days challenge. I completed many other challenges before this day but none that were long enough days/streaks to be considered part of this challenge. I recently decided to switch from learning Python to learning JavaScript, with the goal of becoming a full-stack JS developer. I'm very excited to participate in the 100 days challenge and look forward to everything I will experience, people I'll meet and things I'll learn.

### Day 1: June  6, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I completed 10 challenges in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today was difficult because I moved and was super tired. Once I was settled enough at my new place I sat down and worked through some of the challenges on freeCodeCamp. I kept dozing off. I'm glad I did it though! I really want to stick to this. I completed a few challenges yesterday but they didn't add up to an hour so I'm not counting them.

### Day 2: June 7, Friday 

**Today's Progress:** I completed 22 challenges in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was more rested today so I was able to work through more challenges more quickly than the last few days. I'm still enjoying myself! I got a few courses on Udemy to eventually work through. I'm looking forward to that as well. Definitely see this going somewhere.

### Day 3: June 9, Sunday 

**Today's Progress:** I finished 20 challenges on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was another tiring day moving the last few things from my old place to my new one. It was tough focusing since I'm so tired but I got some challenges done. I'm so close to finishing the Responsive Web Design Certification section of freeCodeCamp. After this, I think I'll start the web dev bootcamp course by Colt Steele. The grind continues!

### Day 4: June 11, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress:** Today, I completed 7 challenges on freeCodeCamp. Yesterday, I completed 4. I also started working on my first project for the Responsive Web Design Certification, building a tribute page.

**Thoughts:** I'm finally done with the first section of challenges! I'm very excited about my progress so far. For my first project of building a tribute page, I chose Keanu Reeves as the subject. I'm excited about Cyberpunk 2077 and am a huge fan of Keanu Reeves, and since those were some of the web topics I was viewing today, I decided to go with it. It will be a work in progress until it's complete so don't judge the CodePen based on what's there now. I'll keep updating this log as well as tweeting out my progress.

### Day 5: June 12, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress:** I finished the Tribute Page and started working on the Survey Form project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It's great seeing everything come together with these projects! I was able to finish the Tribute Page but I'm still tweaking it here and there to make it more responsive.

### Day 6: June 13, Thursday 

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the Survey Form.

**Thoughts:** This one was a little trickier and I had to do some Googling, looking back at FCC challenges, etc. The Survey Form is coming along though. I should be done with it in one more session.

### Day 7: June 14, Friday 

**Today's Progress:** I tweaked my Tribute Page project and completed my Survey Form project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I remember why I enjoyed coding so much! Seeing something come into existence after putting in some work is worth the trial and error. This survey form definitely took some trial and error. I had to glance at the sample code a few times but I made sure I commented out portions and re-enabled them to understand what everything does. I'm getting more comfortable with the code formatting and just now switched to 2-space indentations since that seems to be the norm for JavaScript. For the survey form project, I created one seeking feedback to improve Twitch.

### Day 8: June 16, Sunday 

**Today's Progress:** Started working on the Product Landing Page project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I decided to make a product langing page for learning JavaScript with the products being books you can buy from Amazon. I haven't gotten to the point of adding the products yet so depending on how it works out, this could change. I got half of the tests passing right now but there's still a lot of design work I need to complete to make it look good. This one will probably take 2-3 more days to complete depending on how much time I get in during each session.

### Day 9: June 17, Monday 

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the Product Landing Page project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I almost finished this project but I've run into some CSS snags. I'm having trouble centering some things and getting things properly responsive. I've turned to the freeCodeCamp forum for some feedback. I'm still very proud of this project though. It took a lot more work and research than the others.

### Day 10: June 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Product Landing Page and started working on the Technical Documentation Page.

**Thoughts:** With some help from the freeCodeCamp forum, I was able to fix that positioning issue I had with the Product Landing Page. I also started working on the Technical Documentation Page and chose to do a remixed version (according to the project requirements) of the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) documentation. It's not done yet and will probably take me another day or two.

### Day 11: June 20, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Technical Documentation Page project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** One more project to do and I'll get the Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp! I'm very excited. As I mentioned in my last log update, I made a remixed version (according to the project requirements) of the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) documentation. I used the colors in the Phaser v3 logo to pay tribute to Phaser. It gave the site an awesome, retro look. Everything seems to be working responsively the way it should. On to the last one for this certification!

### Day 12: June 21, Friday

**Today's Progress:** Started the Personal Portfolio project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Last project! I made some progress but this one will take at least another day or two. I need to figure out how I'd like to display my projects. I see the code FCC used for their example so it will definitely help but I'm giving mine a more personal touch that matches the theme I've used for many of my profiles. I might even make this my emTr0.dev site for GitHub Pages.

### Day 13: June 22-23, Saturday-Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Personal Portfolio project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I finished the last project for the Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp! I can't believe it. Time flew. Onto the main goal...JavaScript!

### Day 14: June 24, Monday

**Today's Progress:** Started the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification section of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Working with HTML and CSS was fun but this is what I really like. Making things happen in the background with code. This feels comfortably familiar to me since I switched from Python but I feel like I'll be able to do more of what I want with JS.

### Day 15: June 25-26, Tuesday-Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Started and continued working on the Basic JavaScript section in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Had to break this one up between two days. IRL things have me tired so I did what I could. This is the part of programming that I enjoy though. The creation and execution of code that makes things happen in the background. Web design with HTML and CSS was fun but I'm really excited to get started with JavaScript.

### Day 16: June 27-28, Thursday-Friday

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the Basic JavaScript section of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I don't have many thoughts for what I've learned during these days. It's pretty much a review on what I learned with Python except I'm learning how to do it with JavaScript. Gotta get through the basics!

### Day 20: July 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Happy 4th of July! I spread out my work today since I was doing a bunch of running around but I got a decent amount done. I like that the challenges are increasing in difficulty. It makes the learning stick when you have that lightbulb moment after working so hard to figure one out.

### Day 21: July 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the ES6 section of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The challenges are taking longer to complete because I find myself looking back at references for refreshers on how certain things are done. I wonder if that means I'm not effectively learning or that's normal and expected once you get to the more in depth content. Also I'm tired and found myself staring blankly at the screen a few times XD. I might need to review these challenges tomorrow to make sure they stuck. I didn't have the energy to do more than I did below, unfortunately.

**Link to work:** 

1. [Use Destructuring Assignment To Assign Variables From Objects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-destructuring-assignment-to-assign-variables-from-objects)
2. [Use Destructuring Assignment To Assign Variables From Nested Objects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-destructuring-assignment-to-assign-variables-from-nested-objects)
